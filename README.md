# kafka-sample

The project contains 2 simple samples. They are the producer sample and the consumer sample. They show how to use Kafka in a ASP.NET application.

There are all required configured services in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Run `docker-compose up -d` in the root folder and it creates the services in your Docker, or just use Visual Studio. To check that messages are sending and receiving, use the log console in Docker or Visual Studio, or go to Kafka console [http://localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003).
